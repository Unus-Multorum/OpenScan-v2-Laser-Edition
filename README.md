Project Overview

This project aims to redesign the OpenScan v2 to allow key structural components to be manufactured using laser-cut parts, while maintaining as much compatibility as possible with the original 3D printed design.
The primary focus is on larger components such as the rotating arm and base. These parts are time-consuming to 3D print and, in some cases, may exceed the build volume of common 3D printers. Laser cutting offers a faster and more accessible alternative for producing large flat parts, enabling easier and more efficient assembly.

Wherever feasible, the redesigned parts retain the original mounting points and dimensions to ensure interoperability with the existing OpenScan ecosystem.
